# 🧠 Project Flywheel:

> This repository serves as the central nervous system for my learning journey. It is a public commitment to a hands-on, project-driven approach to acquiring deep skills. Build a series of projects where each project spins this flywheel faster.

Inspired by the principles in books like *Ultralearning*, *So Good They Can't Ignore You*, and *Show Your Work!*

## 🌀 The Flywheel Method 

Learning is not linear; it's a self-reinforcing flywheel. This process is designed to build momentum and turn curiosity into capability.

1.  **Ideate & Deconstruct:** Choose a compelling project and break it down into the core skills and concepts required.
2.  **Build & Tinker:** Engage directly with the problem. Write code, solder circuits, and build prototypes immediately. This is where real-world problems surface.
3.  **Learn & Refine:** When you hit a wall, dive deep. Read docs, watch tutorials, understand the why.
4.  **Solidify & Share:** Document the hard-won knowledge. Create atomic Anki cards for critical facts and document the project's journey, code, and learnings publicly here on GitHub.

**This is a personal experiment in learning.** I'll be testing this strategy in real-time and refining it as I go. Feel free to follow along and let the flywheel spin! 🌀
