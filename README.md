# ðŸŒ€ Project Flywheel:
Let flywheel spin!



> This serves as the central nervous system for my learning journey. It is a public commitment to a hands-on, project-driven approach to acquiring deep skills. Build a series of projects where each project spins this flywheel faster.

Inspired by the principles in varios books, forget "Learn 1 Hour of CSS." Think in terms of "Quests" that combine your goals. Each quest is a tangible project that forces you to learn the necessary skills.

## ðŸ§  The Flywheel Method:

Learning is not linear; it's a self-reinforcing flywheel. This process is designed to build momentum and turn curiosity into capability. Here are the steps:

1. ðŸ”¹**Ideate & Deconstruct**  
   Choose a compelling project and break it down into the core skills and concepts required.

2. ðŸ”¹**Build & Tinker**  
   Engage directly with the problem. Write code, solder circuits, and build prototypes immediately. This is where real-world problems surface.

3. ðŸ”¹**Learn & Refine**  
   When you hit a wall, dive deep. Read docs, watch tutorials, understand the why.

4. ðŸ”¹**Solidify & Share**  
   Document the hard-won knowledge. Create atomic Anki cards for critical facts and document the project's journey, code, and learnings publicly here on GitHub.

**This is a personal experiment in learning.** I'll be testing this strategy in real-time and refining it as I go. Feel free to follow along and let the flywheel spin! ðŸŒ€
